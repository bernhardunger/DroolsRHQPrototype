This repository contains prototype software for testing of Drools rules engine behavior.
General description of use cases and background information for usage scenarios can be found at [8].

Main goal of the prototype software is the measurement of CPU-utilization and memory-consumption by generation of any (RHQ) system events that are evaluated by the Drools rules engine.
The project has been developed as Maven project in an Eclipse IDE, the Eclipse Drools Plugin is useful for editing of DRL files and evaluation of log files and can be downloaded from [1].
The root of the project and the POM file are in directory:
droolsPrototypeSources/

The individual tests are implemented as JUnit-Tests and can be found at:
src/test/java/de/bernhardunger/drools
The JMS test suite can be found at:
src/test/java/de/bernhardunger/drools/jms
Note: The JMS tests need a JMS provider like ActiveMQ [7]. 
Drools rules DRL files are located in:
src/main/resources/de/bernhardunger/drools

An example configuration of the JMS provider and useful batch files for the integration of the test suites on a windows platform can be found in: 

doc/activemq.xml

doc/start_cmd.bat
doc/start_eclipse.bat
